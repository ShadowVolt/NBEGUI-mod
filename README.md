## NeXAS Bin String Editor GUI - String Export Mod

A primitive frontend for the NXSBinEditor library, modified to output raw strings instead of binary data.

I made this mod in order to output plain text from baldr sky, to be used alongside [zbspac](https://github.com/uyjulian/zbspac). Doesn't work to reimport scripts to the game; for that, [use the original](https://github.com/marcussacana/NXSBinEditor). I also didn't finish making multi-file import, so you will have to load each file one at a time. If anybody wants to fix that, be my guest.
