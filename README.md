## NeXAS Bin String Editor GUI - String Export Mod

A primitive frontend for the NXSBinEditor library, modified to output raw strings instead of binary data.

Made this mod to output text from baldr sky, used alongside zbspac. Does not work to re-import scripts to the game; for that, [use the original](https://github.com/marcussacana/NXSBinEditor). I also didn't finish making multi-file import, so you will have to load each file one at a time. If anybody wants to fix that, be my guest.
